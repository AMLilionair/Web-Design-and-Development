## LAB PRACTICE: Python Basics

# Implement a game where the user tries to guess a number between 1 and 20.
#
# Your program must generate a random number between 1 and 20.
# The user should get cues on whether their guesses are too high or too low.
#
# Tip: Use a while loop.

# Import the randint function from the random module
from random import randint

# Generate a random number between 1 and 20
random = randint(1, 20)
print(random)
