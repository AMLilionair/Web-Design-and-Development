This tutorial covers the first part of constructing a website for Laguna Brava Ecotourism, a fictitious business in the ecotourism sector. You will begin the website's construction by designing the content to include and then structuring the content using HTML tags. In the following tutorial, you will complete the website by adding styling and responsive design.

## Understanding the business: Laguna Brava Ecotourism

Laguna Brava Ecotourism is a fictitious company based in Guatemala. Laguna Brava Ecotourism is managed by local community members who provide guided visits to lake Laguna Brava. Surrounded by mountains, the beauty of Laguna Brava lies in the variety of colors of its waters, which depends on the sun's position. 

Laguna Brava is located in a remote and highly underdeveloped region in western Guatemala, near the border with Mexico. Despite the incomparable beauty of Laguna Brava, the lake is little known and receives very few visitors per year.

Laguna Brava Ecotourism wants to take advantage of Web technologies to promote their guided visits and increase customers from overseas. Laguna Brava Ecotourism knows very well that a higher number of visitors and responsible tourism practices are essential to support the development of the local community.

Laguna Brava Ecotourism arranges essential hospitality and transport services for its customers. *In this version of Laguna Brava Ecotourism's website, you will focus on promoting the company's guided visits.* Laguna Brava Ecotourism provides two options for guided visits: the "lake challenge" and the "sit back and relax."

- In the lake challenge option, visitors cross the lake in a kayak guided by a local guide for a full experience of everything the lake has to offer. The journey takes about 5 hours, and it is physically demanding recommended for only those in an excellent physical condition. The price for this option is 50 USD and a minimum of 2 people.
- In the sit back and relax option, visitors board a rowing boat that takes them around the most beautiful parts of the lake. The journey takes about 3 hours and does not require physical effort. The price for this option is 40 USD and a minimum of 2 people.

## Single-page websites

You will implement Laguna Brava's website as a single-page website. Single-page websites are an alternative to the traditional design that includes multiple pages. The single-page website design fits on a single page, and there no additional pages.

To navigate to different parts on a single-page website, users click navigation clicks that allow them to jump to destinations on the same page or scroll down the page to reach other sections of content.

Singe-page websites are suitable for sites or web applications that are not heavy on content and intended to showcase one main idea. Since at this time, the focus is on promoting Laguna Brava Ecotourims's two options for guided visits, a single-page website suits this purpose. 

Now that you understand the business (or at least have a clear idea of what the company wants), the next step is to decide what content to include. The [content design document](content-design.md) contains guidelines to help you determine the information to include in the website. Then, continue with the [structuring content document](content-structure.md) for guidelines on structuring the information using HTML tags.

## References

When writing the business case for constructing a website (or any information system in general), it is essential to include a list of references to the sources of information consulted. You also need to take care of the reputability of your sources and use only reliable and trustworthy information.
