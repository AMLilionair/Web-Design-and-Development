Learning objectives:
- Understand the content design process for the creation of informative and valuable websites
- Structure content using the standard version of HTML tags

This tutorial covers the first part of constructing a website for Laguna Brava Ecotourism, a fictitious entity representing members of a local community in Guatemala. You will begin the website's construction by designing its content and then structuring the content using HTML tags. In the following tutorial, you will complete the website by adding styling and responsive design.

## Understanding the business: Laguna Brava Ecotourism

Laguna Brava Ecotourism is a fictitious entity based in Guatemala. Laguna Brava Ecotourism consists of local community members who provide guided visits to lake Laguna Brava. Surrounded by mountains, the beauty of Laguna Brava lies in the variety of colors of its waters and surrounding nature.

Laguna Brava is located in a remote and highly underdeveloped region in western Guatemala. Despite the incomparable beauty of Laguna Brava, the lake is little known and receives very few visitors per year.

Laguna Brava Ecotourism wants to take advantage of Web technologies to promote their guided visits and increase the number of visitors. Laguna Brava Ecotourism knows very well that a higher number of visitors and responsible tourism practices are essential to support the development of the local community.

Laguna Brava Ecotourism arranges essential hospitality and transport services. *In this version of Laguna Brava Ecotourism's website, you will focus on promoting the community's guided visits.* Laguna Brava Ecotourism provides two options for guided visits: the "lake challenge" and the "sit back and relax." Both options provide life vests and local guides who know the lake very well and take care of safety.

- In the lake challenge option, visitors cross the lake in a kayak guided by a local guide for a full experience of everything the lake has to offer. The journey takes about 5 hours, and it is physically demanding recommended for only those in an excellent physical condition. The price for this option is 50 USD and a minimum of 2 people.
- In the sit back and relax option, visitors board a rowing boat that takes them around the most beautiful parts of the lake. The journey takes about 3 hours and does not require physical effort. The price for this option is 40 USD and a minimum of 4 people.

## Single-page websites

You will implement Laguna Brava's website as a single-page website. Single-page websites are an alternative to the traditional design that includes multiple pages. The single-page website design fits on a single page, and there no additional pages.

To navigate to different parts on a single-page website, users click navigation clicks that allow them to jump to destinations on the same page or scroll down the page to reach other sections of content.

Singe-page websites are suitable for sites or web applications that are not heavy on content and intended to showcase one main idea. Since at this time, the focus is on promoting Laguna Brava Ecotourims's two options for guided visits, a single-page website suits this purpose. 

Now that you understand the business (or at least have a clear idea of what the company wants), the next step is to decide what content to include.
- The [content design document](./content-design.md) contains guidelines to help you determine the information to include in the website
- Then, continue with the [structuring content document](./content-structure.md) for guidelines on structuring the information using HTML tags

## References

When writing the business case for constructing a website (or any information system in general), it is essential to include a list of references to the sources of information used. You also need to take care of the reputability of your sources. The use of reliable and trustworthy sources is essential for strengthening the credibility and appeal of your case. 

In this case, all information included above come from an article published by one of the most prominent newspapers in Guatemala. When relying on fictitious entities, such as Laguna Brava Ecotourism and their services, you should explicitly state them as fictional.
