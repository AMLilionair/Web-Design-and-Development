# Tutorial #3: Adding version control

Complete the following guidelines to add your web development project under version control in Git and share your repository in GitHub.

First, install in your computer the latest version of the Git client from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). In this tutorial, we will use the text-mode (command-line) interface of Git. Later, you may switch to a GUI client. The reason to learn how to use the command-line client first is that most of the documentation is written for the command-line client. Understanding how the command line client works first will certainly make it easier to learn any GUI client later, while the opposite is not necessarily true.

Begin with the Working with GitHub guideline and then proceed with the Working with Git Using the Command Line guideline.
