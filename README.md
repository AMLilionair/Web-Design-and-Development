### Download the resources

We will use the [New Age](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/new-age) template from the [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) website. Download the template from [here](https://github.com/josecarlosgt/Web-Design-and-Development/raw/tutorial-9-content-panels-coffee/new-age-template.zip).

You will also need a few assets, like images and favicon, that you can download from [here](https://github.com/josecarlosgt/Web-Design-and-Development/raw/tutorial-9-content-panels-coffee/assets.zip).

## The business case: Café con Causa (Coffee with a Cause)

Café con Causa (Coffee with a Cause) is a nonprofit organization in Guatemala that commercializes Guatemalan coffee to generate resources that create and sustain educational projects in the country's rural communities. Café con Causa provides a commercial platform that involves small producers who grow and harvest coffee. Café con Causa purchases the coffee at a fair price and commercializes it with Guatemala's individuals and companies. All the profits generated by product sales are donated to community schools in the rural areas to promote education for children and youth.

Café con Causa has been a success in Guatemala. Café con Causa has drawn the attention of dozens of companies in the country, from the smallest to the largest in the country, who believe in the causes promoted by the nonprofit. From the success in Guatemala, the CEO of Café con Causa recognized a growth opportunity in the United States to expand Café con Causa's customer base and take the development of community schools in rural Guatemala to new heights. 

We will take the initiative to promote the expansion of Café con Causa in Guatemala as a context for this tutorial. We will build a website prototype that emphasizes the cause promoted by Café con Causa and the organization's need to project an honest and open image to its potential customers, given its status as a nonprofit organization. 

We will use the following text to complete the tasks below:

> ***Page title:*** Café con Causa
>
> ***Welcome blurb:*** We commercialize Guatemalan coffee to generate resources that create and sustain educational projects in the rural communities of the country.
>
> **Transparency (section)**
>
> We believe in the importance of being transparent in everything we do by providing you with information on costs, expenses, earnings and impact data.
>
> **Production costs (subsection)**
>
> Thanks to alliances with our suppliers who believed in the project, we managed to have a production cost of $2.34 per unit.
>
> **Expenses Reloaded (subsection)**
>
> Transportation and administration expenses as well as 17% on tax expenditure represent only $1.49 per each bag of coffee.
>
> **Profits (subsection)** 
> 
> With a sales price of $9.00, we generate a profit of $4.77 per unit, which is entirely invested on educational projects.
>
> **Frequently Asked Questions (section)**
>
> - How much does a pound of coffee cost?
> - How can I make an order?
> - How can I place an order from the United States?

## Task 0: Page's settings and introduction

Before creating the content panels, let's create the page title and headings.

Update the webpage head settings.

```html
<title>[PAGE TITLE]</title>
<meta name="description" content="[DESCRIPTION]" />
```

Note the folder assets/img contains an image called "cup-934x800.png". Use the site [ICO Convert](https://icoconvert.com/) to convert the image in PNG format to a .ico image that you can use as a favicon.

> A favicon (short for favorite icon) is a file containing small icons associated with a particular website or web page. Browsers that support favicon display show the page's favicon in the browser's address bar and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks.

Then, place the .ico image in the assets/ folder and update the link element with the .ico path.

``html
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="[IMAGE PATH]" />
```

Give the webpage a main heading and an enticing introduction (welcome blurb). You may also include the organization's logo in the header section. 

```html
<img class="img-fluid" src="..." alt="...">
<h1 ...>[MAIN HEADER]</h1>
<p class="lead ...">
    [WELCOME BLURB]
</p>
```

## Task 1: [Slider](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/carousel/)

A slider positions a series of images next to each other but only shows one at a time. The images then slide from one to the next. In bootstrap, the slider is called carousel.

This slider loads several panels but only shows one at a time:

```html
<!-- Slider -->
<div id="carousel-films" class="carousel slide" data-bs-ride="carousel">
    <div class="carousel-inner">
        <div class="carousel-item active">
            <img src="assets/img/placeholder.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
            <img src="assets/img/placeholder.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
            <img src="assets/img/placeholder.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- End of Slider -->
```

Notes:
- The *.active* class needs to be added to one of the slides; otherwise, the carousel will not be visible. 
- Also, use a unique id on the *.carousel* to allow controls (below)
- The *data-bs-ride* attribute controls the autoplay
- The carousel uses the *[d-block](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/display/)* and *[w-100](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/sizing/)* to ensure on carousel images to prevent browser default image alignment.

### Slider with controls

The following slider provides buttons that allow users to navigate between each of the slides:

```html
<!-- Slider -->
<div id="carousel-films" class="carousel slide" data-bs-ride="carousel">
    <div class="carousel-inner">
        <div class="carousel-item active">
            <img src="assets/img/placeholder.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
            <img src="assets/img/placeholder.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
            <img src="assets/img/placeholder.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
        </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Slider controls -->
    <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#carousel-films"
        data-bs-slide="prev">
        <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        <span class="visually-hidden">Previous</span>
    </button>
    <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#carousel-films"
        data-bs-slide="next">
        <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span>
    </button </div>
</div>
<!-- End of Slider -->
```

> Create a slider using the Bootstrap carousel component. Replace the *placeholder.png* and *alt* with your content.

## Task 2: [Cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/)

Now, we will organize the content of the transparency using the Bootstrap cards component. A card acts as a content container that includes options for headers and footers. 

We will use the *article* element to create each card:

```html
<article class="col-lg card border-0">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="..." alt="...">
    <div class="card-body">
        <h4 class="card-title text-center">[TRANSPARENCY SUBSECTION]</h4>
        <p class="card-text">
            <p class="mb-2">
                [TRANSPARENCY SUBSECTION DESCRIPTION]
            </p>
        </p>
    </div>
</article>
```

> Create three cards with the content of the transparency section.

## Task 3: [Collapse](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/collapse/)

The transparency content may be made your webpage look saturated with too much text. We can display only a fragment of the content by default and allow the user to expand the rest.

We can use the collapse component to achieve this effect. Bootstrap uses a JavaScript plugin to show and hide content. Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are mapped to specific elements you toggle. Collapsing an element will animate the height from its current value to 0.

Edit your cards content to show only one or two sentences and use the collapse component to hide the rest. Use Lorem ipsum text to hide the content:

```html
<article class="col-lg card border-0">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="..." alt="...">
    <div class="card-body">
        <h4 class="card-title text-center">[TRANSPARENCY SUBSECTION]</h4>
        <p class="card-text">
            <p class="mb-2">
                [TRANSPARENCY SUBSECTION DESCRIPTION]
            </p>
            <div class="mb-2">
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm py-0" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"
                    data-bs-target="#collapse-transparency-1" aria-expanded="false"
                    aria-controls="collapse-synopsis-1">
                    Read more
                </button>
            </div>
            <p class="collapse" id="collapse-transparency-1">
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam euismod quam a ligula mollis imperdiet. Morbi rhoncus vehicula suscipit.
            </p>
        </p>
    </div>
</article>
```

> Note the collapse behavior relies on assigning an identifier to the content to be expanded (e.g., *collapse-synopsis-1*). This identifier also appears on some of the properties (e.g., *data-bs-target* and *aria-controls*) in the button element that triggers the collapsible behavior. This identifier should be unique. Thus, adding more than one card involves assigning different ids.

The collapse component uses different types of HTML attributes that are common across content panels components in Bootstrap:
- *data-bs-toggle*: data property that specifies collapsible behavior
- *data-bs-target*: data property that specifies the id of the element to be collapsed/shown
- *aria-expanded*: attribute that indicates whether the element is collapsed or expanded 
- *aria-controls*: attribute that creates a cause and effect relationship. It identifies the element(s) controlled by the current element when that relationship isn't represented elsewhere on the page. The more widely the two elements are separated on the page, the more useful the aria-controls attribute becomes.

The Bootstrap JavaScript plugin uses the data properties (*data-bs-target* and *data-bs-toggle*) to implement the collapsible behavior.

Both *aria-expanded* and *aria-controls* correspond to the [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques) standard. These attributes only expose extra information to a browser's accessibility features and do not affect a page's internal structure.

## Task 4: [Accordion](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/)

The accordion comprises a collection of content organized as pairs of titles and panels. When you click on a title of an accordion, its corresponding panel expands to reveal the content.

```html
<!-- accordion -->
<div class="accordion" id="faq-content">
    <article class="accordion-item">
        <h2 class="accordion-header" id="heading-1">
            <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"
                data-bs-target="#faq-1" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="faq-1">
                [FAQ 1]
            </button>
        </h2>
        <div id="faq-1" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" aria-labelledby="heading-1"
            data-bs-parent="#faq-content">
            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>
                    [FAQ CONTENT]  
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </article>
    <article class="accordion-item">
        <h2 class="accordion-header" id="faq-2">
            <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"
                data-bs-target="#faq-2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-2">
                [FAQ 2]
            </button>
        </h2>
        <div id="faq-2" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="heading-2"
            data-bs-parent="#faq-content">
            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>
                    [FAQ CONTENT] 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </article>
</div>
<!-- End of accordion -->
```

> Create one more accordion item. When creating your accordion, take the same considerations you took when using the collapse component, especially when assigning the identifiers for each item in your accordion.
>
> Also, note the first accordion item contains the *.show* class and *aria-expanded="true"*. The hidden items have *aria-expanded="false"* and their buttons have the class *.collapsed*.

## Task 5: [Modal Window](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/)

Also known as pop-up, the modal window is content that appears "in front of" the rest of the page's content.

We will create a "Contact Us" [form](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/
) as a modal using Bootstrap modal component.

The template provided to you already contains, as part of the navigation bar, the button to trigger the modal window:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary rounded-pill px-3 mb-2 mb-lg-0" data-bs-toggle="modal"
    data-bs-target="#feedbackModal">
    <span class="d-flex align-items-center">
        <i class="bi-chat-text-fill me-2"></i>
        <span class="small">Contact Us</span>
    </span>
</button>
```

The content for the modal window will typically sit within the page, but it is hidden when the page loads using CSS. Add the modal content at the bottom of the page:

```html
<!-- Feedback Modal-->
<div class="modal fade" id="feedbackModal" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="feedbackModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
    <div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-centered">
        <div class="modal-content">
            <div class="modal-header bg-gradient-primary-to-secondary p-4">
                <h5 class="modal-title font-alt text-white" id="feedbackModalLabel">Send feedback</h5>
                <button class="btn-close btn-close-white" type="button" data-bs-dismiss="modal"
                    aria-label="Close"></button>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body border-0 p-4">
                <form>
                    <div class="form-group mb-4">
                        <label for="email" class="form-label">Email address:</label>
                        <input type="email" class="form-control" id="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
                    </div>
                    <div class="form-group mb-4">
                        <label for="name" class="form-label">Name:</label>
                        <input type="text" class="form-control" id="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
                    </div>
                    <div class="form-group mb-4">
                        <label for="comment" class="form-label">Comment:</label>
                        <textarea class="form-control" id="comment" rows="3"></textarea>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <button class="btn btn-secondary rounded-pill btn-lg disabled w-100" id="submitButton" type="submit">Submit</button>
                    </div>
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- End of Feedback Modal-->
```

## Other Content Panels

Bootstrap also has available several other components to implement content panels:
- [Offcanvas](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/offcanvas/)
- [Dropdowns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/dropdowns/)
- [Tabs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navs-tabs/)

## Part III: Publish your Webpage

Create a repository for your webpage on GitHub. Then, publish your webpage to the Web using GitHub Pages.

Include a `README.md` file to your project with the URL of your webpage on the Web using the following syntax:

```
# [TITLE OF THE WEBPAGE] 

[Link to the webpage on the Web]([INCLUDE THE LINK HERE])
```
