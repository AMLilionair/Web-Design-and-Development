# Structuring the content of your website

This document describes the steps for structuring the information that you want to include in your website in a HTML document. 

Each task provides links that explain the purpose of each HTML tag. These links provide from two sources:

- [Mozilla MDN web docs](). This website contains detailed and up-to-date documentation on HTML.
- [W3Schools]() This website contains examples and brief explanations of HTML.

When completing the tasks below, keep in mind that you are not expected to memorize each available tag that exists in HTML. However, you should understand how the basic HTML tags work, what is their purpose, and how to use to structure information in HTML documents that align with the business requriements.

## Task 1: Creating the basic structure

When creating a webpage from scratch, the first step is to create some basic tags that every page must have. These are:

- [\<html\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html): represents the root of an HTML document and indicates that anything in between is HTML code.
- [\<head\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head): contains information about the webpage (rather than information that is shown within the browser's window).
- [\<title\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title): the contents of the \<title\> element are shown on top of the browser window or page's tab.
- [\<body\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body): contains the document itself. It indicates that anything between it and the closing \</body\> tag should be shown inside the browser's window.

    <html>
        <head>
            <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
    </html>

To start creating your webpage, write down the code above in a text file using a source-code editor (e.g., VS Code). Save the text file with the name "index.html".  As a convention, the home page or main page of any website is located in a file called index.html. By default, web servers will render the content in this file when a user visits a website.

Now, try to open it using a web browser by clicking on the index.html file. When opening the text file in the browser, you should get a blank page.

You will notice that the URL in the browser starts with "file:". This prefix in the URL indicates that the browser is using the File protocol because the HTML file lives locally on your computer. If you were accessing the index.html file through the Web, then your browser would have to use the HTTP protocol.

## Task 2: Specifying the title

Fill in the \<title\> element with the title that you want to give to your website.
