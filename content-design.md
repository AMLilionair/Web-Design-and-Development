# Guidelines for content design

This section outlines a design process that will help you decide what content to include in your website. The design process begins by considering who might be visiting your site (target audience) and then ensuring the pages feature the information those visitors need. 

## Target audience: Who is the site for?

Every website should be designed for the target audience. *A target audience is a specific group of people most likely to respond positively to the information presented on the website.*

It is not uncommon for clients to think that a site is for the entire world. Realistically, it is unlikely to be relevant to everyone. If a site sells light bulbs, even though most people using a computer probably use light bulbs, they will not likely order them from someone in a different country.

Even if the site has a broad appeal, you can still think about the target audience's demographics, such as:
- What is the age range?
- Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
- Which country do your visitors live in?
- Do they live in urban or rural areas?
- What is the average income of visitors?
- What level of education do they have?
- What is their marital or family status?
- What is their occupation?
- How many hours do they work per week?
- How often do they use the web?
- What kind of device do they use to access the web?

Identifying a target audience can influence design decisions from colour palettes to the level of detail in descriptions.

**So, how can we describe the target audience of Laguna Brava Ecotourism's website?**

> Laguna Brava Ecotourism is certainly targeting people who like nature and adventures. A relevant consideration comes from Laguna Brava's area, i.e., a remote and highly underdeveloped region, and the type of activities offered by the business. Thus, Laguna Brava Ecotourism potential customers are unlikely to be young families with babies or those who fancy the comfort of a five-star resort. Furthermore, we can think of describing Laguna Brava Ecotourism target audience as:
> - Young to middle-aged adults
> - Male and female
> - Single individuals, couples, or people travelling in groups
> - International travellers living outside Guatemala
> - Average to higher-income

## Visitors' motivations and goals: Why people visit your website?

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will visit your website by chance, most will visit for a specific reason.

The goals of your users should influence your content and design. There are two points you can think of to determine why people are coming to your website:
- *Discover underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site.*
- *Examine specific goals of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site at a particular time.*

Regarding the underlying motivations of your visitors, you can think of:
- Are they looking for general entertainment, or do they need to achieve a specific goal?
- If there is a particular goal, is it a personal or professional one?
- Do they see spending time on this activity as essential or a luxury?

**What do you think are the motivations of the Laguna Brava Ecoturism website visitors?**

> The Laguna Brava Ecotourism website's visitors are likely to be travellers looking for a nature experience in an exotic location.

Regarding specific goals,  you can think of:
- Do they want general information/research (such as background on a topic/company), or are they after something specific (such as a particular fact or information on a product)?
- Are they already familiar with the service or product you offer or need to be introduced to it?
- Are they looking for time-sensitive information, such as the latest news or updates on a particular topic?
- Do they want to discover information about a specific product or service to help them decide whether to buy it or not?
- Do they need to contact you? If so, can they visit in person (which might require opening hours and a map)? Or might they need email or telephone contact details?

**What specific goals do you think visitors of Laguna Brava Ecoturism's website may have?**

> Specific goals of Laguna Brava Ecotourism website's visitors may include booking a guided visit or contacting Laguna Brava Ecotourism for more information.  

Keep in mind that it is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site, but you are looking for motivations and specific goals. You can create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site. Then, you can discuss them with other people like friends or members of the design team.

## Information needed: What information your visitors need?

You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information your visitors need to achieve their goals quickly and effectively. 

You may look at why people have to visit your site and determine what they need to achieve their goals. You can prioritize information from key points down to non-essential or background information. Ensuring that you provide the information that your visitors are looking for will consider your site more relevant.



**What information do you think visitors of Laguna Brava Ecoturism's website require to achieve their goals?**

> Likely, potential travellers to Laguna Brava won't know anything about Laguna Brava or may have safety concerns about visiting the region, given its remote location and underdevelopment status. Thus, the Laguna Brava Ecotourism website should provide all relevant information addressing these concerns for those interested in visiting the region and hiring the company's guided visits.
>
> Also, the website should include information specific to each type of guided visit, such as price, duration, minimal number of people, and the highlights.

## Wireframes

A wireframe is a sketch of the relevant information that needs to go on each site's page. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require. By creating a wireframe, you can ensure that all relevant information is included.

The wireframes make design easier because you know what information needs to appear on which page before considering how the page should look. It can be very helpful to show the wireframes of a site to a client before showing them a design because:
It enables the client to ensure the site has all the functions and information it needs to offer.
If you just present a site design to a client, it is common for them to focus on how the site looks, which means they may not raise issues about its function after the site has been built.

[EXAMPLE]

You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe. It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and indicate the most important parts of each page.
